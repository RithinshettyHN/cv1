Flaticon is best to pic images for skills and other action oreented skills
Giphy is another websit for good gif for our website
CSS button generator, search this to add button to our website
Favicon= how to creat one, we need to go to favicon.cc on google
<div>= is a special HTML element that allows us to drive our content up on owr website, so that we can structure each div separately,it does nothing by itself,it does nothing unless we use CSS with it, essentially a div stands for a content division element,it basically allows us to split our content into separate containers so that we can affect the layout of each separately
</div>
NOTE: see if we give width:600px; then this is the static pixels, this don't changes
    but if we give width: 100; then that refers to the percentage of the viewport, you know that

Playing with the (width*height),border,padding,margin,
1.
width: 200px;
height: 200px
2.
border:solid;
3.
border-width: 50px;  //it increases the width of the border in all direction by 50px
border-width:0px 10px 20px 30px; //this is to give width of 0,10,20,30 pixel in top,right,bottom and left
4.
padding:20px; //this is to give padding of 200px
5.
margin:10px; //this is buffer zone arround our image, where there is free space around the out image by 10px in all direction

Display
There sre three Display property
1.block
2.inline
3.inline-block
4.none

1.block are those elements which take up hole width of the project by default, like your text will take up
      complete width of that page, even though you don't write for complete width they also block other
      elements from sitting next to it,both at its right and left
      eg:headers,list and list items,paragraph,form,division
      pitfall:it never allows any element to occupie its whole width of the line of the page
      syntax: display:block;
              <p>abcde</p>
2.inline are those which only the required amount of space and never covers complete width
      good eg is span, see what ever you write in the <p> </p> will take entire width of page of that linten
      but what wvwr we write between <span> </span> will take only the required about og space
      eg:anchor(these are the link that we upload as text)
        images are also inline
       pitfall:it can't be resized like paragraph
       syntax: display:inline;
               <span>abcde</span>
3.inline-block are used to over come above two pitfalls,they accupy only required amount of space and is resizable
      eg:images
4.none it simply removes that element from the wwebsitee,as if it did't exist
       syntax: display:none;
Three are mainly 3 default things happens in positioning
1.Content is everything=if we use the large front then it take more space
2.Order comes from code=the code is exeguted in the order we write the code
3.Children sit on the parents=there are actually 3 dimention in our webside
                  for eg: <div>
                          <h1>a <span>pro</span>programmer</h1>
                          </div>
                  see in the above eg consider from computer to viewer direction,
                  the div sits 1st, on top of that a and grammer sits and on top of that pro sits

Position property
1.static
2.relative
3.absolute
4.fixed

1.static position:static is simply go along the code, without changing any position, simply go as per the code
2.relative position:
    eg:
    img
    {
    position:relative;  //to give extre 30px space between left edge of the screen and the image,i.s simply move image 30px to the rigtht from left
    left:30px;
    }

coordinates:
there are 4 coordinates 1.top
                        2.bottom
                        3.left
                        4.rigtht
img
{
position:relative;  //this is must code to use below property
top:20px;  //moved down ny 20px
left:20px; //moved rigtht
right:200px;
bottom:20px;
}
remember,moving a image(foe eg) does't change the position of other elements
if we move down,then

think like This
if the image was at top left corner and if we give right:200px then it moves towards left and we can't see it, even though it is there

3.absolute positioning
see here if we give left:20px; then there will be 20px space from the left edge to that picture
if we give right:20px; then there will be 20px space from the right edge to that picture
another difference is if there are 3 colors one below the other of size 200*200 each, then imagin, if we move first image
right by 400px then the 2nd color comes to the 1st position, then 3rd image comes to 2nd position this happens because
when we push 1st image by 400px, then it is assumed that the 1st position of the 1st color is forgotten, as if it was not there
therefore other two will shift up
</picture>

Font styling:we have serif,sans-serif,inherit,fantasy,cursive
Serif:we have littel feets in all of the alpabets edges
sans-serif:we lack the littel feets in all of the alpabets edges
monospace=each of the characters in the word take up same amount of width eg:in coding we use this, more readable
fantasy:low readable,like avatar movie poster style
cuursive:hand written like handwritting and low readable
NOTE:we can specify the a font or many font based on your preference of showing the people(cause some computer can't show some font,it is based on there downloads)
    another thing to remember is that we can also force all the user to see same font by linking the link by font embeding by searching fonts.google.com
NOTE:serif is default for website
syntax:
font-family:font_classes; eg: font-family:sans-serif;
NOTE:one of the san-serif class is areal,vardana,etc
font-family:verdana,sans-serif;  //first it gives preference to verdana, if not possible it goes to sans-serif
we are using sacramento,like handwritting

font-size is inherited, see giving font-size twice will simply adds up the font-size, only if we use static or rem we can prevent this
